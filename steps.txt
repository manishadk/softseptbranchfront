devtool: 'inline-source-map'



1) webpack-dev-server, live realoding by default, , laternative -> --watch 

npm install --save webpack-dev-server

command : webpack-dev-server


+   devServer: {
+     contentBase: './dist',
+   },
This tells webpack-dev-server to serve the files from the dist directory on localhost:8080.

webpack-dev-server doesn't write any output files after compiling. Instead, it keeps bundle files in memory and serves them as if they were real files mounted at the server's root path. If your page expects to find the bundle files on a different path, you can change this with the publicPath option in the dev server's configuration.

"publicPath" is "URL path where the webpack files are served from", just like a url-prefix

"contentBase" is "the directory to serve files non-webpack files from", serve file not generate by webpack


2) implement hot reloading
